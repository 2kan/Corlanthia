Starting up a new project: a text adventure. It's written in Java and the development will probably be slow since I have a lot of school work and I'm in exam week at the moment, but I am determined to finish this.

Corlanthia will be a relatively simple text adventure until I am happy with the engine and how things work. Once I'm happy with it all, I'll start to add new features and make the entire game something that's worth playing.


** UPDATE **

Corlanthia now has basic gameplay features implemented. Currently the user can only move in cardinal directions (i.e. north, south, etc) and upon entering a new room a message is displayed. The message assumes that you are entering the room for the first time, so a message for repeat entry still needs to be implemented.

I added some average story to it and a reference to portal :)

Development will continue tomorrow.


** NOTE **

I am aiming to get some kind of "demo" done as a basic proof-of-concept, and then I will decide if I want to take it further. I'm hoping that this will be done in the next 6 weeks as the holidays are coming up close and I'll be able to get a lot of work done. By then there should be a nice system setup and it will be playable.... somewhat.
