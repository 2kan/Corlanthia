Starting up a new project: a text adventure. It's written in Java and the development will probably be slow since I have a lot of school work and I'm in exam week at the moment, but I am determined to finish this.

Corlanthia will be a relatively simple text adventure until I am happy with the engine and how things work. Once I'm happy with it all, I'll start to add new features and make the entire game something that's worth playing.

Until then, I will commit the source code once I'm finished with it for the night, if anyone wants to take it and have a look at it or whatever, go ahead; just don't say that it's yours unless you have made substantial edits to it :)
