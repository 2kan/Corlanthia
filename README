Corlanthia is an in-development text adventure game written in Java.

Corlanthia has some basic features implemented; so far users can move cardinally, inspect items, pickup items, see their inventory, drop one or many items, look in the room to see what objects are there. There is also a "debug" command that so far adds items to a room and displays all of the items in the room.

** UPDATE v0.1.8 **

+ Added a method to count the items in the room.
+ Added a debug command that displays the number of items in the room.
* Items were redone and so was pickup, drop and look.


** NEXT ACTION **

Possibly re-implement the inspect command and remove CheckRoom and CloseRoom methods.

Add more debugging commands.

Eventually add support for NPC-like features.
