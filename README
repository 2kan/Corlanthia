Corlanthia is an in-development text adventure game written in Java.


** UPDATE **

Corlanthia now has basic gameplay features implemented. Currently the user can only move in cardinal directions (i.e. north, south, etc) and upon entering a new room a message is displayed. The system assumes that you are entering the room for the first time, so a message for repeat entry still needs to be implemented.

I added some average story to it and a reference to portal :)

Development will continue tomorrow.
