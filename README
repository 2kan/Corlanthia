Corlanthia is an in-development text adventure game written in Java.


** UPDATE **

Corlanthia has some basic features implemented; so far users can move cardinally, inspect items, pickup items, see their inventory, drop one or many items, look in the room to see what objects are there. There is also a "debug" command that so far adds items to a room and displays all of the items in the room.

Items are implemented very poorly and there are a lot of things that need to be changed if someone simply wants to add an item to the game. I will be redesigning this and it will be done for v0.2
