---- NOTICE: Corlanthia is no longer under development due to my joining of a development studio, I'm still deciding whether or not I'll leave the repo up or not, but for now it's still here ----

Corlanthia is an in-development text adventure game written in Java.

Corlanthia has some basic features implemented; so far users can move cardinally, inspect items, pickup items, see their inventory, drop one or many items, look in the room to see what objects are there. There is also a "debug" command that so far adds items to a room and displays all of the items in the room.

With the way that books are implemented, there can only be one per room.

** UPDATE v0.1.9 **

+ Added command 'lookat' to replace look, works the same as inspect
+ Added new debug command 'look', is alias to 'showitems'
+ Added Debug.java
+ Added letter item
+ Implemented function to read a book or a letter
* Moved debug method from Actions.java to Debug.java
* Re-coded inspect method and is now much more versatile
* Merged all <Item>Desc arrays into a multi dimensional array
- Removed 'look' command (still remains in debug though)
- Removed CheckRoom and CloseRoom methods


** NEXT ACTION **

Add more debugging commands.

Eventually add support for NPC-like features.
